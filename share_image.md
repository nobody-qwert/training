# Workout Plan Social Media Image Share Feature

## 1. Technical Approach

We'll need to:

1. **Create a workout plan image generator**
   - Use HTML5 Canvas or a library like html2canvas to convert the workout plan into an image
   - Design a visually appealing template for the workout image
   - Render the plan data onto this template

2. **Add UI elements**
   - Add a "Share as Image" button in the share modal
   - Create a preview of the generated image before sharing

3. **Implement sharing functionality**
   - Add methods to download the image
   - Add direct sharing to social media platforms

## 2. Detailed Implementation Plan

### A. Image Generation

We'll use the html2canvas library to capture the workout plan and convert it to an image. However, instead of capturing the existing UI (which might not be optimized for social sharing), we'll:

1. Create a hidden div with a custom-designed template specifically for social sharing
2. Populate this template with the current workout plan data
3. Use html2canvas to convert this hidden div to an image
4. Apply styling to make it visually appealing and brand-consistent

### B. UI Changes

1. Add a "Share as Image" button to the existing share modal
2. Create a new modal or section to preview the generated image
3. Add download and social sharing options for the image

### C. Technical Components

```javascript
// Example of the main functions we'll implement:

// 1. Function to generate the image template
function generateWorkoutImageTemplate(workoutPlan) {
  // Create HTML structure for the workout image
  // Style it for social media sharing
  // Return the populated template
}

// 2. Function to convert the template to an image
async function convertTemplateToImage(templateElement) {
  // Use html2canvas to convert the template to an image
  // Return the image data URL
}

// 3. Function to handle sharing the image
function shareWorkoutImage(imageDataUrl, platform) {
  // Implement sharing logic for different platforms
  // Or provide download option
}
```

## 3. Visual Design Considerations

The image should:
- Have a clean, professional look that represents your brand
- Include your logo or site name for recognition
- Display the workout plan in a concise, visually appealing way
- Use colors that match your existing UI
- Be properly sized for social media platforms (optimal dimensions vary by platform)

## 4. Libraries Needed

- **html2canvas**: To convert HTML to an image
- **file-saver** (optional): For easier image downloading
